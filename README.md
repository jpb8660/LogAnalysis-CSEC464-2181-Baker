To use you should have python installed on the computer you are using it on.  Once downloaded, just double click onto the LogAnalysis.py file, and it should pop up in command line.  If it doesn't you may have to open up command line and type "python LogAnalysis.py" to run it.

Once running just enter in the number for log search and it will bring you to a menu with the different options.  I would suggest you use the first option first to create a file of the logs on the drive you select.  Most of the other options do this, but it makes it easier to have the file already compiled.
You can then decide to to either then use the keyword search or the timeline search to find log files, which then create a list of the log files found in the selected search.  I added the last option to allow you to view the files your searches found.  Just open up the txt file with the logs you want to check and then copy the filepath into the command line and you can look at the content of the log file.
